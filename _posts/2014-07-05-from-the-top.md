I've been meaning to start blogging for quite some time, and just haven't gotten around to it until now. So I'll start by explaining well, how I've gotten to this point...

***

A little over a year ago, I found myself somewhat complacent with my situation at the time. Don't get me wrong, I had an awesome job with [Real Salt Lake](http://realsaltlake.com). I was about 2 years out of college with a degree in sports management, on track to have a comfortable career in the professional sports industry, what more could I ask for. The relationships I made while in this position aside, I found that sending emails and returning phone calls day in and day out quickly became a little mind numbing. Not to mention the long hours and six day work weeks got old, very fast. On one of the very few weekends I had off during the season, while searching through the endless glory that is Netflix, I came across a movie called The Startup Kids. It is a great documentary about several young entrepreneurs, founders of companies like Vimeo, SoundCloud, and DropBox to name a few, that started their respective companies with only their knowledge of coding and an idea. That to me was incredibly powerful. Now I'm not aspiring to have the next 'big' startup, but after hearing about how much fun/frustrating/how much of a challenge coding and building something from scratch is, I was intrigued.

That was when it really began for me. I almost immediately started researching different languages, frameworks, etc and was blown away by how much there was and how many different opinions there were about where I should start. I did as many tutorials as I could get my hands on starting with html/css and eventually moving on to [Michael Hartl's Rails tutorial](http://railstutorial.org). Which by the way, I could not recommend more to anyone who is looking to get started with programming. This guy has dedicated a ton of time to making this tutorial clear, concise, and FREE (well it was free and now very cheap...) for anyone who is interested. The three or so months I took to go through it in its entirety was when I figured out that, "Hey, this is something I really want to seriously pursue as a career..."

By the time I was finishing the tutorial, towards the end of January this year, I had changed companies to a great startup called [Friendemic](http://friendemic.com), where I essentially got to work with a group of my best friends all day, but I still wanted more. That was when I came across Bitmaker Labs. I had been researching bootcamps in the states for quite some time, but to leave no stone unturned, I literally googled, "web development bootcamps toronoto". Lo and behold, Bitmaker Labs was the first to pop up. I applied, soon after interviewed, and soon after that was accepted to the June cohort. It took me about a week to make my decision, an extremely difficult one at that, and about four months later I had sold everything I owned, crammed what I had left in my jeep, and made the approximately 2000 mile (roughly 3200 km for my metric friends) trip to Toronto. We're now in week 5 (like I said, I've been meaning to start a blog for a while now) and I could not be happier with my decision to drop everything and make the move to become a developer.

More to come with my experience at Bitmaker Labs thus far...
