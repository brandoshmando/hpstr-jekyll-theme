I won't bore you with details about my experience. If you're interested, you can check out my <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bcraft-resume/bcraft-resume.pdf" target="_blank">résumé</a> for the nitty gritty details of my past work. Instead, a little bit about myself...

I'm a product of the Midwest who fled to the mountains of the Wasatch front to ensure that my class schedule at the University of Utah was balanced with my skiing schedule. In addition to skiing and hiking, I also enjoy golf and the "lake lifestyle" during the summer. I like to think I'm a beer snob as well. Though, who can resist an ice cold Coors Light?

I'm also a junior, full stack ruby developer and have experience with Javascript, jQuery, and Ajax. I learned my craft through both self study and [Bitmaker Lab's](http://bitmakerlabs.com) web development bootcamp.

Finally, Wear Sunscreen...
