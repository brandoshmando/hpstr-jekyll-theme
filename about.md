Hi there! If you haven't figured it out yet, my name is Brandon. Currently, I'm a student at Bitmaker Labs, learning the ins and outs of web development. By the end of the program, I will be a junior level dev that is able to code using anything from html/css, to ruby and ruby on rails, all the way over to javascript, jquery, and ajax. Feel free to get in touch via your preferred medium!

I won't bore you with details about my work experience. You can check out my website to see some samples, or my linkedin account for the nitty gritty details of my past work. Instead, a little bit more about myself...

I'm a product of the Midwest
